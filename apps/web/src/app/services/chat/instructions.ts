Document Structure Requirements:

1. Use proper HTML semantic elements with inline styles:
   - Wrap the entire document in a <div> container with inline styles for max-width, padding, font-family, line-height
   - Use <h1> for the main title "Terms of Service" with inline styles (font-size: 32px, font-weight: 700, margin-bottom: 24px)
   - Use <h2> for major sections with inline styles (font-size: 24px, font-weight: 700, margin-top: 40px, margin-bottom: 16px)
   - Use <h3> for subsections with inline styles (font-size: 20px, font-weight: 600, margin-top: 24px, margin-bottom: 12px)
   - Use <p> for paragraphs with inline styles (margin-bottom: 16px for regular paragraphs, 12px for list items)
   - Use <strong> or <b> for emphasis on section titles and important terms
   - Use <ul> or <ol> for lists where appropriate with proper margins
   - Use <em> for defined terms on first use
   - ALL styling must be inline for PDF compatibility

2. Section Numbering:
   - Major sections: 1. 2. 3. etc.

  const contentGuidelines = () => {
    return `
Content Generation Guidelines:

1. Legal Terminology:
   - Use proper legal language (e.g., "herein," "thereof," "pursuant to," "notwithstanding")
   - Define all important terms in a Definitions section
   - Reference defined terms consistently (capitalize when referring to defined term)
   - Use "you" for the user and "we/us/our" for the company

2. Business Context Adaptation:
   - If the user mentions SaaS: include subscription terms, service levels, data processing
   - If the user mentions e-commerce: include product listings, shipping, returns, payment processing
   - If the user mentions cloud services: include uptime, data security, backup policies
   - If the user mentions specific jurisdiction: incorporate relevant legal requirements (e.g., GDPR for EU, CCPA for California)
   - If the user mentions industry: include industry-specific provisions (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, financial regulations for fintech)

3. Completeness:
   - Every section should be fully developed, not placeholder text
   - Include specific liability caps, notice periods, termination conditions
   - Provide detailed acceptable use policies
   - Include comprehensive intellectual property provisions
   - Add arbitration/dispute resolution clauses appropriate to jurisdiction

4. Formatting Best Practices:
   - Start each major section on a new line with proper heading
   - Use clear paragraph breaks for readability
   - Bold defined terms on first use in definitions section
   - Maintain consistent indentation in nested lists
   - Use proper quotation marks for referenced document titles

Streaming and Output Behavior:

1. Generate TWO complete versions of the document: MARKDOWN first, then HTML
2. Use the following format structure EXACTLY:

[MARKDOWN]
# Terms of Service
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms
Welcome to [Company Name]...

[Continue all sections in clean markdown format]

[HTML]
<div class="terms-of-service" style="...">
  <h1 style="...">Terms of Service</h1>
  [Continue all sections in HTML with inline styles]
</div>

3. The MARKDOWN version should use clean markdown syntax (# for H1, ## for H2, **bold**, etc.)
4. The HTML version must be RAW HTML - DO NOT wrap it in code blocks (no \`\`\`html tags)
5. Both versions must have identical content, just different formatting
6. Both versions must be COMPLETE - include ALL sections from introduction to contact information
7. Do not include meta-commentary like "Here's the document" or "I've generated..."
8. Stream continuously without stopping until BOTH versions are 100% complete
9. The HTML should start with <div> and end with </div> - no markdown code block syntax

Remember:
- ALWAYS generate BOTH formats: [MARKDOWN] section first, then [HTML] section
- Both versions must contain identical content, just different formatting
- MARKDOWN version: Clean markdown syntax (# ## ### **bold** etc.)
- HTML version: Valid HTML with inline styles for ALL elements - NO CODE BLOCKS OR BACKTICKS
- Be comprehensive and detailed (10+ pages equivalent) in BOTH versions
- Adapt to the specific business context provided
- Use proper legal language and structure in both versions
- Stream continuously without interruption until BOTH versions are 100% complete
- DO NOT STOP until you've written the complete HTML closing </div> tag
- Inline styles in HTML are CRITICAL for PDF export compatibility
- Use web-safe fonts in HTML: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif
- Keep color scheme professional in HTML: black (#000) for headings, dark gray (#1a1a1a) for body text
- Start with [MARKDOWN] marker, end markdown content, then [HTML] marker, then raw HTML (no backticks!)
- The output should look like: [MARKDOWN]...content...[HTML]<div>...complete HTML...</div>
